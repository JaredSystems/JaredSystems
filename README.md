I'm a programmer based in Miami, FL. I enjoy systems programming, but most of my time is spent working with web and mobile development.

### üß™ Projects

#### Full Stack Development

* **[Marmot Systems](https://www.marmotsystems.com/)**: Direct Store Delivery (DSD) and accounting B2B solution for companies. Worked as a business partner at a dairy company, we relied on similar software, but it was bloated and expensive. So, I built my own solution.

* **[Galaxity Learning](https://www.galaxitylearning.com/signin)**: Automated AI math tutoring app integrated into school LMS systems. While tutoring math to children during college, I wanted to create a gamified learning app for them that integrates with teacher tools like Schoology and Google Classroom. 

* **[FreeMind Recovery](https://github.com/CalculusCoder/FreeMind-Backend)**: A full stack web application dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of anxiety recovery services, resources, and tools. Over 1,000 users. This was the first full-stack app I built to learn web development. 

#### Security / Cryptography

* **[Cryptography Library](https://github.com/CalculusCoder/c-cryptography-library)**: A cryptography library supporting 2 encryption ciphers and 1 key exchange algorithm (Diffie-Hellman). The core logic is built in C, with a Node.js bridge via Child Process and a frontend for encrypting text. 

**Tools I love working with:**
